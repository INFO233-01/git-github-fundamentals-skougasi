# A Bit about Me
### Hi. I'm Sonya, an accounting student at Ramapo College who decided to dip her toes in coding
### GitHub seems similar to Microsoft Teams, but for software developers. 
### I'm still not really clear on how developers transfer code to and from the platform.
### Also, is the platform better for certain coding languages than others?
